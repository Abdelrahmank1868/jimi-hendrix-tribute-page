    <p>[Verse 1]</p>
    <p>Down the street you can hear her scream "You're a disgrace"</p>
    <p>As she slams the door in his drunken face</p>
    <p>And now he stands outside</p>
    <p>And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool</p>
    <p>He cries "Oh girl, you must be mad</p>
    <p>What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"</p>
    <p>Against the door he leans and starts a scene</p>
    <p>And his tears fall and burn the garden green</p>
    <p>[Chorus]</p>
    <p>And so castles made of sand</p>
    <p>Fall in the sea eventually</p>
    <p>[Verse 2]</p>
    <p>A little Indian brave who before he was ten</p>
    <p>Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends</p>
    <p>And he built a dream that when he grew up</p>
    <p>He would be a fearless warrior, Indian Chief</p>
    <p>Many moons passed, and more the dream grew strong</p>
    <p>Until tomorrow he would sing his first war song</p>
    <p>And fight his first battle</p>
    <p>But something went wrong</p>
    <p>Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night</p>
    <p>[Chorus]</p>
    <p>And so castles made of sand</p>
    <p>Melts into the sea eventually</p>
    <p>[Verse 3]</p>
    <p>There was a young girl whose heart was a frown</p>
    <p>'Cause she was crippled for life and she couldn't speak a sound</p>
    <p>And she wished and prayed she could stop living</p>
    <p>So she decided to die</p>
    <p>She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore</p>
    <p>And to her legs she smiled, "You won't hurt me no more"</p>
    <p>But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say</p>
    <p>"Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way"</p>
    <p>And it really didn't have to stop</p>
    <p>It just kept on going</p>
    <p>[Outro]</p>
    <p>And so castles made of sand</p>
    <p>Slips into the sea eventually</p>
